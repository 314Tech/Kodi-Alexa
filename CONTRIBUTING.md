# Contributing

I am open to recieve pull requests from anyone who is willing to put the time in to contribute to the project, I just ask that you follow the following guidelines:

* Update the README with new features and especially if something requires extra setup.
* Update the CHANGELOG with a new version number giving a brief description of what you did.
* Update the utterances.txt file for any new intents you made
